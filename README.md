ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

# Introduction
The emerging open science movement provides an opportunity to topple decades of scientific inequity by creating tools that enable engagement in science by underprivileged or marginalized communities. In this movement, scientific data, code, and knowledge, are shared openly in findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (F.A.I.R.) forms. However, it is not enough to make software and code available. Scientists need the opportunity to test their hypotheses in a way that increases their understanding while contributing to the broader scientific community.  

Take as an example, electrodeposition which is a method for coating a thin layer of one metal on top of a different metal to modify its surface properties. It is widely used industrially to create corrosion-resistant coatings for automobiles, improve electrical and thermal conductivity in electrical components, and manufacture screens. Optimizing the composition, surface finish, and density of an electroplated alloy is a tedious manual process that involves controlling the concentration of ions and surfactants, the cathodic current, and the temperature of the plating solution. State of the art autonomous deposition tools are currently only possible in well-funded research labs such as at NIST and NRC, where there are active projects within this space.

# Project Description
This research proposes a low-cost and open-source electrochemistry robot controlled by a GPT agent. 
 
# Outcomes
The critical advantage of this robot is that it can be used by people who have modest budgets and can provide touch points for materials scientists, roboticists, computer scientists, and ethicists. A major outcome of this project will be the open sourcing of the instructions for constructing and operating this platform and its deployment into local schools.
