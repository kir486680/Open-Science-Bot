## Project Overview

Automated electrochemical testing system that combines a modified 3D printer with electrochemical measurement capabilities. The purpose of this robot is to enable high-throughput electrochemical research under $400. 

The system features:

  - Modified 3D printer frame for automated positioning
  - 3D printed bath design and electrode holders
  - Servo-controlled grippers for electrode manipulation
  - Programmable fluid handling system with peristaltic pumps
  - Integrated potentiostat for electrochemical measurements


## Getting Started

1. Set up the hardware components according to the Mechanical and Electronics documentation
2. Install the required software dependencies
3. Configure the device connections in `devices.json`
4. Run the system using the main.py Python script

## Documentation

## Data

Examples of data collected by the system:


### Bayesian Optimization
