# in case any of this upsets Python purists it has been converted from an equivalent JRuby program

# this is designed to work with ... ArduinoPC2.ino ...

# the purpose of this program and the associated Arduino program is to demonstrate a system for sending 
#   and receiving data between a PC and an Arduino.

# The key functions are:
#    sendToArduino(str) which sends the given string to the Arduino. The string may 
#                       contain characters with any of the values 0 to 255
#
#    recvFromArduino()  which returns an array. 
#                         The first element contains the number of bytes that the Arduino said it included in
#                             message. This can be used to check that the full message was received.
#                         The second element contains the message as a string


# the overall process followed by the demo program is as follows
#   open the serial connection to the Arduino - which causes the Arduino to reset
#   wait for a message from the Arduino to give it time to reset
#   loop through a series of test messages
#      send a message and display it on the PC screen
#      wait for a reply and display it on the PC

# to facilitate debugging the Arduino code this program interprets any message from the Arduino
#    with the message length set to 0 as a debug message which is displayed on the PC screen

# the message to be sent to the Arduino starts with < and ends with >
#    the message content comprises a string, an integer and a float
#    the numbers are sent as their ascii equivalents
#    for example <LED1,200,0.2>
#    this means set the flash interval for LED1 to 200 millisecs
#      and move the servo to 20% of its range

# receiving a message from the Arduino involves
#    waiting until the startMarker is detected
#    saving all subsequent bytes until the end marker is detected

# NOTES
#       this program does not include any timeouts to deal with delays in communication
#
#       for simplicity the program does NOT search for the comm port - the user must modify the
#         code to include the correct reference.
#         search for the lines 
#               serPort = "/dev/ttyS80"
#               baudRate = 9600
#               ser = serial.Serial(serPort, baudRate)
